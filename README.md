# My Crypto Portfolio App

This is a simple React application designed to display the current prices of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano. This application was developed using a unique "vibe-coding" methodology, with significant contributions from the `gemini-cli` tool.

## Features

*   **Real-time Crypto Prices:** Fetches and displays the latest prices for BTC, ETH, and ADA using the CoinGecko API.
*   **Coin-based Access:** Users receive 1 free coin upon loading the app. Access to cryptocurrency prices requires "paying" 1 coin.
*   **Local Cache:** Coin balance and payment status are persisted using local storage.
*   **Reset Functionality:** A convenient reset button in the footer allows users to clear their coin balance and payment status.
*   **Personalized Footer:** Includes links to the developer's LinkedIn and GitHub profiles with stylish icons.

## Development Methodology: Vibe-Coding with Gemini-CLI

This project is a testament to the power of "vibe-coding" â€“ an intuitive, iterative development process driven by immediate feedback and creative flow. The `gemini-cli` played a pivotal role in this process, acting as an intelligent pair-programming assistant. From setting up API calls and managing state to implementing new features and refactoring code, `gemini-cli` facilitated rapid development and allowed for a highly interactive coding experience.
